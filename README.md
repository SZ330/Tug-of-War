# Tug-of-War
Playing a game of Tug of War against the computer as the second player
The user plays against the computer, which is generated using a Linear Feedback Shift Register. When one player wins, the game field will reset while the score is incremented and displayed. The LFSR is controlled using the switches on the DE1-SoC board, resulting in slower or faster computer moves based on LFSR and binary representation of the switches.
